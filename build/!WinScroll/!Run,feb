| Obey file to configure and run the WinScroll module.
|
| Uncomment this line and set the sprite file path up correctly to use
| alternative sprites.  Watch out for trailing spaces in the filename!
|
| Set WinScroll$Sprites <Obey$Dir>.Sprites

RMRun <Obey$Dir>.WinScroll

| Uncomment this line and set the options as required.  For example:
| "-Speed 40 -Square" is a sensible set of options to do non-linear scrolls.
| "-Speed 1" would produce faster linear scrolling than the default.
| "-Modifier 9" would set the invocation to Select-Menu.
| Use as many *WinScrollConfigure commands as required.
