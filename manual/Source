<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Windows Scroll</cite> is a small module for RISC OS to provide the kind of scrolling that is available on <cite>MS Windows</cite> when the wheel button of the mouse is pressed.  It does not, however, need a wheel mouse to work.

There are still things to be done to <cite>Windows Scroll</cite>: see <link ref="Issues">Known issues</link> for details.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installation and use" file="Using">

To install <cite>Windows Scroll</cite>, copy the <file>WinScroll</file> module on to your hard disc and then double-click on it to run it.  If you want to use <cite>Windows Scroll</cite> permanently, add it to your machine's boot sequence.

The <file>RunWS</file> Obey file included in the archive can be used if you wish to change the <cite>WinScroll</cite> configuration (speed, key-presses or sprites) by default.  It should be in the same directory as the <file>WinScroll</file> module; you may wish to create a specific directory and then place non-standard sprite files here as well.

Once installed, clicking <key>ctrl</key>-<mouse>menu</mouse> over a window with scroll-bars will open a small <window>arrow window</window> under the mouse pointer.  This contains a 'centre point' and a set of arrows indicating which scroll directions are possible (this depends on which scroll bars are present on the original window).  Moving the mouse away from the point in the direction of one of the arrows will cause the window to scroll in that direction; the further the mouse is moved, the faster the scroll.

To stop the scrolling, click the mouse (doing this over the <window>arrow window</window> will prevent the mouse click being registered anywhere else).

</chapter>




<chapter title="Configuration and options" file="Config">

Various configuration options are available for <cite>Windows Scroll</cite>.

Most configuration of <cite>Windows Scroll</cite> is done via the command line, using the <command>*WinScrollConfigure</command> command.  This takes a number of parameters, that allow the various options to be set.  It is not necessary to supply all of the parameters each time.  If the command is used with no parameters, the current settings are displayed.


<comdef target="*WinScrollConfigure" params="[options]">

The <command>WinScrollConfigure</command> command is used to configure the WinScroll module.  It takes a number of parameters, depending upon which aspects of operation are to be configured.

The options available are as follows:

<definition target="-Button &lt;button&gt;">
The <command>-button &lt;number&gt;</command> option sets the mouse button used to invoke the scrolling (when pressed along with the modifier key).  The value passed is one of:

<list>
<li>4 - <mouse>select</mouse>
<li>2 - <mouse>menu</mouse>
<li>1 - <mouse>adjust</mouse>
</list>

For example: <code>-Button 2</code> would set the <mouse>menu</mouse> button.

The default button is <mouse>menu</mouse>.  Using other buttons is not recommended, since it may not always be possible for <cite>Windows Scroll</cite> to see them.
</definition>

<definition target="-Modifier">
The <command>-modifier &lt;key number&gt;</command> option sets the key that must be pressed with the chosen mouse button to start a scroll.  The value passed is an 'Internal key number', a list of which can be found in the PRMs or StrongHelp Manuals; the most useful codes are:

<list>
<li>0 - <key>shift</key> (either, but 3 - left, 6 - right)
<li>1 - <key>ctrl</key> (either, but 4 - left, 7 - right)
<li>2 - <key>alt</key> (either, but 5 - left, 8 - right)
<li>9 - <mouse>select</mouse>
<li>10 - <mouse>menu</mouse>
<li>11 - <mouse>adjust</mouse>
</list>

For example: <code>-Modifier 4</code> would set the left <key>ctrl</key> key as the modifier.

The default key is <key>ctrl</key>.  Since the key-presses are not masked out from other tasks, be careful which keys you use.  Mouse buttons are possible, with the problems that the clicks will still be registered and that PS/2 mice do not register more than one button at a time.
</definition>

<definition target="-Speed">
The <command>-speed &lt;speed&gt;</command> option sets the speed of the scrolling and is used in conjunction with the <command>-square</command> and <command>-linear</command> options.  The &lt;speed&gt; parameter is used as a divider: the lower the value, the faster the scrolling for a given mouse movement.

For example: <code>-Speed 4</code> would set the set the speed to half the default.

The default speed is 2 (linear).
</definition>

<definition target="-square and -linear">
The <command>-square</command> and <command>-linear</command> options set whether the speed increase is linear compared to the distance between the centre point and the mouse or if it goes up according to the square of the distance.  When using square control, the speed parameter should be set higher, say 40 to 50.

The default is for linear control.
</definition>

An example command might be

<codeblock>
*WinScrollConfigure -Speed 40 -Square
</codeblock>

to set 'square-response' scrolling at a sensible speed factor, or

<codeblock>
*WinScrollConfigure -Modifier 9
</codeblock>

to set the modifier key to be <mouse>Select</mouse>.

</comdef>

<subhead title="Sprite files">

It is possible to change the sprites that are used by <cite>Windows Scroll</cite>.  On loading, the system variable &lt;WinScroll$Sprites&gt; is checked.  If this is set and pointing to a valid sprite file, the appropriate file (based on the usual Wimp suffixes) is used in preference to the default sprites stored in the module.

See the sprite files in the <file>Source</file> directory for details about what sprites are required.  When creating a new file, make sure that all the sprites keep the same dimensions and colour depth.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Known issues" file="Issues">

<cite>Windows Scroll</cite> is still in development, and there are a number of known problems.  If anyone find the application useful, I will deal with these.

In addition, the interface (in particular the invocation keys) are up for alternative suggestions.  I would also appreciate bug reports or suggestions for improvements.  My email address is at the end of this file.

The issues I am aware of at present are:

<list>
<li>Scroll area bounds are not checked before Open Window requests are sent to applications.  This is not an issue on RISC OS 4, but I have not tested it on earlier versions.  It is easily fixable.

<li>The way in which menus from Toolbox applications are dealt with is still not ideal (simply calling <code>Wimp_CreateMenu,-1</code> to close them when the open).

<li>Changes to the mouse pointer can be overridden by other applications as the mouse passes over their windows.

<li>Composite windows, where the scroll bars are on a separate window to the one containing the document, will not work as <cite>Windows Scroll</cite> can not see the scroll bars and so will not agree to scroll the window.  <cite>Impression</cite> and <cite>Personal Accounts</cite> are two 'offenders' that I know of.
</list>
